  title: Ellipsoid
  content:
  - A three-dimensional shape characterized by its smooth, curved surface, which
    resembles a <mark=#00563B40>squashed sphere</mark>.
  - Imagine stretching a balloon, it will look like a longer or flatter sphere. While
    an ellipsoid may not have perfect symmetry like a sphere, it still exhibits some
    degree of symmetry depending on its shape.
  - 'An ellipsoid has three axes, which are imaginary lines passing through its center.
    These axes define the shape of the ellipsoid. '
  - Real life examples of ellipsoid are eggs, lemon, and football.
