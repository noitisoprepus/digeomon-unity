  title: Cuboid
  content:
  - 'A three-dimensional shape characterized by <mark=#00563B40>six faces</mark>,
    all of which are <mark=#00563B40>rectangles</mark>. '
  - A cuboid has 12 edges. Edges are where two faces meet. Unlike a cube, a cuboid
    does not have all sides of equal length.
  - A cuboid has eight vertices, also known as corners. Corners are where three edges
    meet.
  - Faces of a cuboid are the six flat surfaces that form its outside. Each face
    is shaped like a rectangle.
  - 'A cuboid has three dimensions: length, width, and height. The length is how
    long it is, the width is how wide it is, and the height is how tall it is.'
  - Cuboids are like shoeboxes, books, or even some buildings like houses. They're
    everywhere around us!
