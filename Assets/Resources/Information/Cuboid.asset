  title: Cuboid
  content:
  - 'A three-dimensional shape characterized by <mark=#00563B40>six faces</mark>,
    all of which are <mark=#00563B40>rectangles</mark>. '
  - 'A cuboid has 12 edges. Edges are where two faces meet.Unlike a cube, a cuboid
    does not have all sides of equal length.A cuboid has eight vertices, also known
    as corners. Corners are where three edges meet.


'
  - 'A cuboid has three dimensions: length, width, and height. The length is how
    long it is, the width is how wide it is, and the height is how tall it is.'
  - Cuboids are like shoeboxes, books, or even some buildings like houses. They're
    everywhere around us!
  - Meanwhile, a cube is a three-dimensional shape characterized by <mark=#00563B40>six
    identical square faces.</mark>. A cube is like a solid block or a box. It has
    six faces, all of which are squares.
  - 'A cube has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Unlike some other shapes,
    all three are the same in a cube. If one side is 5 units long, all sides are
    5 units long.'
  - Cubes are like dice, sugar cubes, or even some buildings like storage boxes.
  - A square is a flat, two-dimensional shape with four equal sides and four right
    angles. Squares are special types of rectangles where all sides are equal in
    length.
