  - A circle is a two-dimensional (2D) shape that looks like a perfectly round ring.
    A circle is defined by a continuous curved line. This line is called the circumference
    of the circle.
  - A circle is symmetrical. This means that if you draw any line passing through
    its center, you will divide the circle into two equal halves.
