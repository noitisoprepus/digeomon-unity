  title: Circle
  content:
  - A circle is a two-dimensional (2D) shape that looks like a perfectly round ring.
  - A circle is defined by a continuous curved line. This line is called the circumference
    of the circle.
  - A circle is symmetrical, meaning any line through its center divides it into
    two equal halves.
