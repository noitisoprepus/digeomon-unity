  title: Cube
  content:
  - Meanwhile, a cube is a three-dimensional shape characterized by <mark=#00563B40>six
    identical square faces.</mark>
  - Each face of the cube is congruent, meaning they all have <mark=#00563B40>equal
    sides and angles.</mark>
  - 'A cube has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Unlike some other shapes,
    all three are the same in a cube. If one side is 5 units long, all sides are
    5 units long.'
  - Cubes are like dice, sugar cubes, or even some buildings like storage boxes.
