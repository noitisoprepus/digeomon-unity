  title: Rectangle
  content:
  - A rectangle is a flat, two-dimensional shape with four straight sides and four
    right angles. It looks like a stretched-out square.
  - A rectangle has four sides. Opposite sides are equal in length and parallel to
    each other.
  - A rectangle also has four right angles, which are angles that measure 90 degrees.
  - A rectangle can be seen as doors, refrigirators, and some windows. They're the
    parts of our house!
  - "To calculate the area of the rectangle, the formula above can be used. \nWhere
    l is the length and\nw is the width"
  - To calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, the formula above can be used.
  - 'Here is an example problem:

    Find the area of a rectangle with a length
    of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm.'
  - 'Solution:

    A= 8 x 5 = 40 cm<sup>2</sup>
