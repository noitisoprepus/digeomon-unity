  title: Triangle
  content:
  - A triangle is a two-dimensional (2D) shape with <mark=#00563B40> three sides,
    three corners and three angles. </mark>
  - Each side is a straight line that connects two corners. Each corner is called
    a vertex. Angles are the spaces formed where two sides meet.
  - The measure of all sides of a triangle equate to <mark=#00563B40>  180 degrees.
    </mark>
  - There are different types of triangles. If all three sides of a triangle are
    the same length, it's called an <mark=#00563B40> equilateral</mark>. If two sides
    are the same length, it's called an <mark=#00563B40> isosceles</mark>. And if
    all three sides are different lengths, it's called a <mark=#00563B40> scalene</mark>.
