## DiGeoMon: A Gamified Augmented Reality Approach for Learning Primary Level Geometry

### Overview

**DiGeoMon** is an innovative educational application developed as an undergraduate thesis by [@noitisoprepus](https://github.com/noitisoprepus), [@kylegermar03](https://github.com/kylegermar03), [@RaevnSight](https://github.com/RaevnSight), and [@Lowkeylao](https://github.com/Lowkeylao). This project aims to gamify the learning experience of primary-level geometry using augmented reality (AR) technology. DiGeoMon integrates AR, image scanning, and gamification elements to create an engaging platform for students to learn and apply geometric concepts interactively.

### Features

- **Augmented Reality Integration**: Utilizes AR to blend primary-level geometry topics like Area, Volume, and various 3D shapes seamlessly into the learning environment.
- **Interactive Learning**: Provides interactive visual learning experiences that enhance understanding and real-world application of geometry.
- **Gamification**: Includes quiz components and leaderboards to motivate and engage students through competitive play.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a hologram UI for displaying DiGeoMon information and quizzes.
- **Multi-Platform Access**: Designed for Android devices with compatibility to Googleâ€™s ARCore service.
